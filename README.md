# Car-Market-Analysis
Hands-on car market analysis project built from scratch by scraping real-world automobile data, followed by data cleaning and exploratory analysis to identify pricing trends and market behavior.
## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves web scraping automobile data from Ackodrive.com and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand pricing patterns across car models, variants, and transmission types.
The project focuses on working with real-world unstructured web data, cleaning it, and extracting insights through visualization.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Car pricing information is often scattered and unstructured across online platforms, making it difficult to compare models and understand market trends. Without structured data, both customers and analysts struggle to make informed decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

▪️ Scrape real-world car data from Ackodrive

▪️ Build a structured dataset from raw HTML content

▪️ Analyze pricing trends across models and variants

▪️ Identify budget and premium car segments

## 🌐 Data Source

▪️ Website: Ackodrive.com

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset was created through web scraping and includes:

▪️ Car Name

▪️ Minimum Price (₹ Lakhs)

▪️ Maximum Price (₹ Lakhs)

▪️ Fuel Type (Petrol)

▪️ Transmission (Manual / Automatic)

▪️ Number of Car Variants

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

▪️ Extracted raw HTML data using BeautifulSoup

▪️ Removed special characters from price fields

▪️ Converted price columns to numeric format

▪️ Handled missing and inconsistent values

▪️ Standardized column names for clarity

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

▪️ Univariate analysis of car prices

▪️ Bivariate analysis of price vs transmission

▪️ Identification of market price segments

## 🔍 Key Insights

▪️ Most cars are positioned in the budget to mid-range segment

▪️ Manual transmission cars dominate the market

▪️ Automatic cars are priced higher and positioned as premium

▪️ SUVs and high-variant models show higher top-end prices

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

▪️ Python

▪️ Requests

▪️ BeautifulSoup

▪️ Pandas

▪️ Matplotlib

▪️ Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of web scraping, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis using Python. It strengthened my understanding of working with unstructured data and deriving meaningful market insights.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

▪️ Include additional fuel types and vehicle attributes

▪️ Perform price prediction using machine learning

▪️ Automate periodic data scraping

▪️ Expand analysis to multiple platforms
